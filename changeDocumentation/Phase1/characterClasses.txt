This file outlines the changes made to implement new chanracter classes
and change some of the old character classes. All changes made exist 
within the parser directory. 

The added character class symbols were '?', '/', '%', '&', '|', '!',
and '_'. The quote was changed from a single quote to double '"'.

In the scan.ssl directory the new scanner input tokens were added under 
the 'Input' header near the top of the file along with the associated
synonyms. This allows the scanner to identify these new incoming symbols
as unique tokens instead of illegals, which would happen in the olf PT
scanner. The quote was the only modification made to an existing
character class.

In parser.pt the initialization of the character class map was modified
from line 917-924 to add the new characters and modify the existing
quote.
