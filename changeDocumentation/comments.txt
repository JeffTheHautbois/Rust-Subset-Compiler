The style of comments was changed in the scanner from the old style
single line commnets of PT { } to the new Qust // and the from the 
block comments of PT (* *) to the new Qust /* */.

The changes were made in the S/SL code in scan.ssl. The new comments
case start at line 166 in scan.ssl when a slash is recognized. If
this slash is followed by another we enter into the standard one line
commnet rule, if the first slash is followed by a '*' we enter into the
block comment rules called AlternateComment and if the first slash is
followed by anything else we emit a pSlash token and move on. This is
different from PT which was two case statements, one for the '{' 
and one for the '('.

For the sinlge line comment rule 'Comment' on line 332, there is no
user written closing symbol, instead the lnewLine token is used to
identify the end of a comment and the program returns from the rule.
If the case finds an EoF before the pNewLine it throws and error
as this is not expected behavior and if it sees anything else it
throws away the characters as they are part of the commented out line.

For the block comment rule 'AlternateCommnet' on line 347, the only
change made is changing the style of closing brace for a block
comment in PT which was *) to Quest */.
