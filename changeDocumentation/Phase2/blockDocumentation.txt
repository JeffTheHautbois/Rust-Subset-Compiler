The block rule was changed in parser.ssl to allow for a mix of statements and declarations,
which is a functional requirment of Qust. Before PT only allowed declarations at the start 
of a block, followed by statements. This change was performed by moving all the cases from the 
statement rule into the Block rule at the same case level. The statement rule was then removed.
The sBegin token is also now emited at the beginning of a block and the sEnd token is emited at 
the end of bock as per the functional requirments of Qust and our desire to minimize the changes
needed at the semantic phase.
