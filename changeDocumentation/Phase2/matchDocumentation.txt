This document outlines the changes of Pt's case to Qust's match. These changes 
all occured in parser.ssl. 

The first change made was the S/SL match in the Block rule which changes the keywork 
'case' to 'match'. Following this the match statement was altered in the CaseStmt
rule. Pt's 'of' was changed to Qust's '{' and Pt's 'end' was changed to Qust's '}' 
to denote the start and stop points of the match. Pt's case for a ';' end of line 
delimiter was also removed as it isn't used in Qust and an equivalent does not exist. 

Next, the MatchAlternate was changed to have alternate match statements started with
the '|' token. An outer case was also added to check for the '_' token denoting the
"otherwise" case for the Qust match. Pt's ':' was then changed to Qust's '=>' and 
matches were made to be able to have any number of statements and declarations by 
calling Block rule. Blocks in a Qust match are also contained inside of the '{' and }'
tokens.
