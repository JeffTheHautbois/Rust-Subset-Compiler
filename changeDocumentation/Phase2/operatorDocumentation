Operator Syntax Changes

Where: Parser.ssl, in ESTF, match statement and Assignment rules. Changes
based on expected token synynoms for QUST language modified from PT standards.

How: PT operators and operations that disagree with QUST standards are modified,
while keeping the output tokens for the semantic phase consistent with PT expectations.
This includes ':=' to '=', 'div' to '/' mod to '%', '=' to '==', '<>' to '!=',
'and' to '&&', 'or' to '||' and 'not' to '!'. 
This also includes adding QUST left brace ("{"), right brace ("}"), plus equals ("+="), minus equals ("â€“="),
length operator '?', and changing PTs ':' to QUSTs '=>'.
This change allows for new operators such as "!=","+=","-=".....etc that 
exist in QUST but not PT to be parsed properly. Comments can be 
found inside parse.ssl for all items removed and added

Why: In order to maintain our non invasive PT to QUST transition the operators
that required no extra functionality but just syntax change were simply swapped,
and ones that required adjustment included changes in relevant rules. These
changes allow our S/SL program to parse QUST instead of PT without changing 
semantic phase expected inputs greatly.
