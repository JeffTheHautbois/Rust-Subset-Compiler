The following changes were made in parser.ssl inside the block rule to introduce Qust's modules. 
Something of this form did not exist in PT and as such nothing was altered or removed, just added. 
The change was simple an added case in the Block rule to look for the key work 'mod'. Following 
this a check for the module's name is made (pIdentifier) followed by a check for it's curley 
brackets which surround another Block call. Throughout this the appropriate semantic token are 
emitted as per Qust's specifications.
