Token Definitions

Where: Parser.ssl input section
How: Copied the output of Scan.ssl from previous phase, adding synynoms 
for the recognized tokens.
Why: In order for the flow of compilation to be logical and conclusive,
the previous phase lexical analysis tokens represent the input to the 
syntactic analysis section of the parser phase. Adding synynoms makes
the S/SL program easier to read and provides clarity to the functionality
of our rules.
