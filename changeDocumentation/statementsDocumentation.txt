If Statements

Where: Parser.ssl, IfStmt rule which is called by Block after consuming 'if'
token. 
How: Implementing a call to block, which includes a surrounding begin and 
end in the output token stream, makes our if statement implementation
non invasive in the semantic phase and successfully constructs if statements
housed in QUST specified statement braces. The if statement call from block
outputs .ifStmt, handles the if expression and outputs it's end, then expects '{', then a call to block handles all declarations and statements
nested inside, and concludes with a '}' closing brace. 
Why: This implementation is non invasive, and the test trace outputs show
the the remaining begin and end outputs. 

If-Else Statements
Where: Parser.ssl, IfStmt rule which is called by Block after consuming 'if'
token. 
How: Implementing a call to block, which includes a surrounding begin and 
end in the output token stream, makes our if statement implementation
non invasive in the semantic phase and successfully constructs if statements
housed in QUST specified statement braces. The if statement call from block
outputs .ifStmt, handles the if expression and outputs it's end, then expects
 '{', then a call to block handles all declarations and statements
nested inside, and concludes with a '}' closing brace. This is then followed
by a choice statement which detects the 'else' keyword followed by a '{' and 
outputs .sElse and then handles the associated declaration and statements 
by once againimplementing block. 
Why: This implementation is non invasive, and the test trace outputs show
the the remaining begin and end outputs. This implementation is also simple
with minimized repition due to the implementation of the Block rule call.

Else-If Statements

Where: Parser.ssl, IfStmt rule which is called by Block after consuming 'if'
token. 
How: Please see If-Else Statement documentation above first. In the same
choice rule detecting the else, an addition 'if' detection is added after 'else'
which triggers a recursive ifStmt rule call that handles the else if QUST
implementation as a nested if statement preceeded by an else. 
Why: In this method, we will not have to implement else if in the semantic 
phase since it will not be seen. This reduction in modification is an efficient
method that satisifies the QUST language Else-If clause. 

While Statements

Where: Parser.ssl, whileStmt rule which is called by Block after consuming 'while'
token. 
How: Implementing a call to block, which includes a surrounding begin and 
end in the output token stream, makes our if statement implementation
non invasive in the semantic phase and successfully constructs if statements
housed in QUST specified statement braces. The while statement call from block
outputs .WhileStmt, handles the expression and outputs it's end, then expects
 '{', then a call to block handles all declarations and statements
nested inside, and concludes with a '}' closing brace.
Why: Using a call to block handles the begin and end conditions while expression
handles the while expression. Similar to if, the PT parser is modified in a 
minor way to handle QUST braces and syntax. 

Loop Statement

Where: Parser.ssl, loopStmt rule which is called by Block after consuming 'loop'
token.
