#Changes were made in semantic.ssl in SimpleType and TypeBody
Why: Qust array type by defaults has lower range index of 1.
And it disallow any user defined range starting greater than 1
How: Modifies sRange in SimpleType to always push one as lowerbound.


#Changes were made in semantic.ssl in VariableDeclaration
Why: Qust supports declaration without type but with initial value
How: Adds additional choice block to handle sInitialValue token
without specifiying type, and force typeStk to default Integer
