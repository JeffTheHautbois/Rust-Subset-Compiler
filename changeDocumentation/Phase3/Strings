Removal of tpPackedArrays
Where: semantic.ssl Operands, AssignProcedure, ConstantValue
Why: tpPackedArrays is no longer the proper presentation for Strings
How: remove tpPackedArrays boundary checking and pushes tpString
and and omit proper String Length after tLiteralString

String Size
Where: semantic.pt oAllocateVariable
Why: String size in Qust is 1024 which is way larger than wordSize
How: adds extra choice in semantic mechanism to allocate stringSize.

Trap Operations
Where: semantic.ssl AssignProcedure
Why: Strings in Qust are no longer represented as tpPackedArray
How: now accepts tpString instead of tpPackedArray and emits length of string
using oValuePush(stringSize) and oValueOmit
