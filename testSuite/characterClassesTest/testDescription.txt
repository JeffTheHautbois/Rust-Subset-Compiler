This set of tests checks the change made to the character classes.
The names of the test files explain what they do rather well. For 
example newPercentPass.pt expects that when run through the scanner
the percent symbol '%' will be recognized and will yeild the output 
of a pPercent token. This obviously requires the implementation of
the pPercent syntax token to function and for this reason the
pPercent will not be re-tested in the syntaxTokenTest directory. One
should be able to extrapolate this example to the rest of the pass
case tests. For failure case tests such as oldQuotesFail.pt we simply
expect an illegal token. The only new character class that was
implemented and not tested here was the ampersand because a single
ampersand does not exist in Qust. Instead the double ampersand is
tested in syntax toekens which offers enough test coverage to ensure
the ampersand has been properly added to the character classes. To 
run all character class related tests run the bash script testAllLocal.sh
