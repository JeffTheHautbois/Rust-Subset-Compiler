This set of tests checks the loop statement along with the break if
statement in parser.ssl. Names of the test fil explain what the test does,
if it is expected to pass or fail. The tests are focused on QUST implementation.
The tests are kept to a minimum to test only the statements, and the call
to block specifying the begin and end of each block inside the loop statement,
while the begin and end braces of the loop and break statement are expected
to be handled in the loop rule itself. The tests output should show
two calls to block, for statements and declarations preceeding and following
the break if statement. The break if statement on the other hand show have
the proper output for the expression associated with the break condition. A 
loop end output token is expected following the ending brace. 

- These tests ensure nothing else was broken after the changes were added,
important since a compiler must be reliable.
- These tests are important since the parser belongs
to QUST and no longer works with the PT if syntax, but rather
it expects QUST syntax provided in the test files. Therefore loop should trigger
our loop statement rule and break if should be handled regardless of the number of
statements or declarations above or below it, which is confirmed by successful 
calls of block which is already tested. 

Cases Tested: 

QUST: loop statement, loop break if statement, optional semicolon
at the end of the statement brace. The file names identify the tests.

* All changes are identified in comments made in parser.ssl
