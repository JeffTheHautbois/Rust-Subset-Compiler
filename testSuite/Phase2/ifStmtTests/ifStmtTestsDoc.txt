This set of tests checks the if statement and expression rule implementation
in parser.ssl. Names of the test files explain what the test does,
if it is expected to pass or fail. The tests are focused on QUST implementation.
The tests are kept to a minimum to test only the statements, and the call
to block specifying the begin and end of each block inside the if statement,
while the begin and end braces of the if statement are expected to be handled
in the IfStmt rule itself.    
- These tests ensure nothing else was broken after the changes were added,
important since a compiler must be reliable.
- These tests are important since the parser belongs
to QUST and no longer works with the PT if syntax, but rather
it expects QUST syntax provided in the test files.

Cases Tested: 

QUST: If statement, If else statement, QUST unique if else if statement, optional semicolon
at the end of the statement brace. The file names identify the tests.

PT 'Then' No Longer Used Kept in output and Tested to simplify semantic implementaion.

* All changes are identified in comments made in parser.ssl
