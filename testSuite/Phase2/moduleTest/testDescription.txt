The tests in the local directory are made for modules which are new to Qust.
Nothing of this type existed in PT so no removed functionality failure case
test was written. In the parser the module is very sinple and there is only 
one logical path so only one test is needed. As exected this test yeilds an
sModule token followed by the an sIdentifier for the module name and then all
token for the following Block.
