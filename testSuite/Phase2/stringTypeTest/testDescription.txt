The expected tokens for the string length operation are sStringLiteral followed by the sLength token.

For the substring operation we expect the sStringLiteral or a sIdentifier followed by the integers tokens associated with the operation and then finally a sSubstring token.

String concatination expects a postfix stream of tokens starting with a pstring literal followed any number of sIdentifiers, sIntegers, or sStringLiterals and then the associated post fix operators.
