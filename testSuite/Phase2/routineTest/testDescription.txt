The following tests for routine expect that a routine should output
an sProcedure token followed by an sIdentifier so the routine name
and following this an identifier for each paran, it's type and a mut
token if applicable. These routines can also be public in which case
sPublic is emited before the sParamEnd token. These tesks produce all
this functionality as expected.

There is also a test to check that the old "procedure" keywork does not work
for the new Qust routines, which use the 'fn' keywork instead.
