The test cases found in this directroy show the new workings of the case structure for Qust. 

Expected output of the pass tests start with an sCaseStmt token followed by tokens for some 
expression. For each case in the match stmt we then expect a set of 1 or more integers, 
followed by an sLabelEnd and then all toekns associated with a Block. After all standard cases 
in the match stmt have finished we may have an 'otherwise' match which emits sCaseOtherwise 
followed by Block tokens. This is all produced by the pass tests as expected.

Fail test uses the "case" keywork from PT which has been removed. As expected the failure case
does not emit an sCaseStmt token.
