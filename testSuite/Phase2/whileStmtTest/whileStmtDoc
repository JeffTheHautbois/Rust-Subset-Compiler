This set of tests checks the while statement and expression rule implementation
in parser.ssl. Names of the test files explain what the test does,
if it is expected to pass or fail. The tests are focused on QUST implementation.
The tests are kept to a minimum to test only the statements, and the call
to block specifying the begin and end of each block inside the while statement,
while the begin and end braces of the while statement are expected to be handled
in the whileStmt rule itself.    
- These tests ensure nothing else was broken after the changes were added,
important since a compiler must be reliable.
- These tests are important since the parser belongs
to QUST and no longer works with the PT if syntax, but rather
it expects QUST syntax provided in the test files.
- 'do' is no longer used in QUST, an error should not appear expecting 'do'.

Cases Tested: 

QUST: While statement, optional semicolon at the end of the statement brace. 
The file names identify the tests.

PT 'do' No Longer Used, tests show it removed in output as per rule implementation.

* All changes are identified in comments made in parser.ssl
