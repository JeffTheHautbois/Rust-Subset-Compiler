This set of tests is concerned with the funcationality of Qust programs.
Only one referance to the main program is allowed (no nesting of programs)
in a given file. The expected output of a program declaration starts with
sProgram followed by sIdentifier tokens for all output params passed to
the program. Finally all tokens associated with a block follow.
