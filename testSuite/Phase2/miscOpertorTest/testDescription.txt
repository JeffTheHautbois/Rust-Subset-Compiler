This set of tests checks the changes as described in "operatorDocumentation"
in changeDocumentation/Phase2. Each operator change is tested by checking if
the new operator behaves as expected and the old operator no longer provides
it's original functionality.

For example: newEqualsPass.pt produces what we expect if an assigment operation
is registered and olfEqualsFails.pt produces what we expect if no assignment 
operationis registered.

This same logic applys across all the test cases. 

Some cases have been omitted such as oldEqualityFail.pt because the old 
equality operator is the new equals operator and therefore has already been 
tested in this section. Others have been omitted such as the '=>' or the '+=' 
operator as they have been tested in other sections and '{' has effectivly 
been tested in every test program.
