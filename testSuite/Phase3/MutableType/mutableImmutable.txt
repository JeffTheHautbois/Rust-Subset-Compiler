What:
This set of tests checks the mutable/immutable setting and
type checking for a variable passed into a condition, as
instructed in the assignment handout. The parser output
from the procedure and variable declaration rules is handled
in the semantic phase and the output is analyzed.
Names of the test files explain what the test does,
if it is expected to pass or fail.

Where:
In the testSuite directory, the output of various rules such
as VariableDecalration, VarActual, AssignmentStmt and procedureHeading
are checked.

Why:
In Qust, not all variables can be assigned, value parameter variables
cannot be assigned. Testing the Mutable declaration and error output
ensures that condition is covered. 

How:
The best method to test mutable declarations and restrictions 
is defining a mutable and non mutable variable, and passing them
into a function that expects a mutable variable. A type mismatch
is expected for the immutable variable passing. 

Cases Tested: 

QUST: If statement, If else statement, QUST unique if else if statement, optional semicolon
at the end of the statement brace. The file names identify the tests.
