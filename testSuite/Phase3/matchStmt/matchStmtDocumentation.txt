This document outlines the changes of the PT case statement to handle the Qust match statements with
optional default alternative. These changes all occured in semantic.ssl.

Changes were made by reusing the CaseStmt S/Sl rule. Adding a condition to handle the sCaseOtherwise before
sCaseEnd.The .tCaseOtherwise is emitted and perform a oSymbolTblPushScope operation to enter a new scope.
Also, the body of the default alternative is handled by the Block S/SL rule and then performed the oSymbolTblPopScope operation to exit new scope. Lastly, emitting the .tCaseMerge. 

Thus, the match statment can handle both cases; when there is a default alternative and when there isn't.
