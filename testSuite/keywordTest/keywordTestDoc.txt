For keyword unit test naming converntion:
xxx is the a single keyword/non-keyword in each .pt unit test

old_xxx_fail.pt are for old PT Pascal keywords that are 
no longer recognized by the Qust screener/scanner

The following old keyword unit test will output 
.pIdentifier accompanied by identifier text value:
div mode or and not then end until do array
program var procedure begin case repeat

new_xxx_pass are for new Qust keywords that are added 
ssltrace -e will output pXxx token for the newly added keywords 

The following new keyword unit tests will output
.pIdentifier token screened to corresponding pKeywordToken:
pub mod main let mut fn loop break match.

changed_xxx_unkwn are for unit tests made to modified predefined identifiers
However the unit tests output are unknown at this stage because 
ssltrace output handles predefined identifiers the same way as a compound
identifier. The unit test is not complete without examining Parser which
is Phase 2 of the project.

The following predefined identifiers will output
.pIdentifier accompanied by associated value text:
int str bool print println
