This set of tests checks the change of the PT comments which used to be { } 
for single line comments and (* *) for block comments to the new Rust style 
which is // for single line comments and /* */ for multi line comments. The 
4 files names explain what they do, newBlockCommentsPass.pt will check the
new /* */ style comments. For comments an expected pass is no token output
other than newLines and EoF. A Fail like seen in oldBlockCommentsFail.pt
will give a token for the braces in (* *) and the all the contents of the
comment. To run all comment related tests run the bash script testAllLocal.sh
