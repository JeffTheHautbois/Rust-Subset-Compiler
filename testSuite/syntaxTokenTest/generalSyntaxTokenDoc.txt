==================================================================
1) Added new QUST output syntax tokens and identifier adjustement in scan.ssl
- This change allows for new symbols such as "!=","+=","-=".....etc that 
exist in QUST but not PT to be recognized during scan. Comments can be 
found inside scan.ssl for all items removed and added
- The implementation was done by adding new input tokens and adjusting 
the scan rule accordingly to properly identify new operators and 
syntax.

2) Added new tests that have full coverage over the added QUST syntax in testSuite
- This change ensures nothing else was broken after the changes were added
- A Pass/Fail indicator in the file names shows the scanner belongs
to QUST and no longer works with the PT unique syntax, but rather
it expects QUST alternative syntax
- The tests included QUST unique cases such as underscores in identifiers,
equal greater, logic operations and other symbols that represented themselves
- All tests can be found in testSuite dir

* All changes are identified in comments made in scan.ssl
