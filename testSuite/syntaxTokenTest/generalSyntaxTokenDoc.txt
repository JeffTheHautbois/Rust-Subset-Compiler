==================================================================
1) Added new QUST output syntax tokens and identifier adjustement in scan.ssl
- left brace ("{"), right brace ("}"), plus equals ("+="), minus equals ("–="), slash ("/"),
percent ("%"), double equals ("=="), double ampersand ("&&"), double or bar ("||"),
or bar ("|"), not ("!"), underscore ("_"), question mark ("?") and equal greater ("=>"),
replacing or removing the old PT symbols that are no longer used in Qust (<>,:=,&,..)
- This change allows for new symbols such as "!=","+=","-=".....etc that 
exist in QUST but not PT to be recognized during scan. Comments can be 
found inside scan.ssl for all items removed and added
- The implementation was done by adding new input tokens and adjusting 
the scan rule accordingly to properly identify new operators and 
syntax.
- Updated ScanIdentifiers and parser.pt to contain the new references
- First word and last word variables updated

2) Added new tests that have full coverage over the added QUST syntax in testSuite
- This change ensures nothing else was broken after the changes were added,
important since a compiler must be reliable.
- A Pass/Fail indicator in the file names shows the scanner belongs
to QUST and no longer works with the PT unique syntax, but rather
it expects QUST alternative syntax
- The tests included QUST unique cases such as underscores in identifiers,
equal greater, logic operations and other symbols that represented themselves
- All tests can be found in testSuite dir

* All changes are identified in comments made in scan.ssl
