This set of tests checks the change made to the syntax output tokens
in sca.ssl.The names of the test files explain what they do rather well.
For example newEqualGreater.pt expects that when run through the scanner
the equalGreater QUST symbol '=>' will be recognized and will yeild the 
output of a pEqualGreater token. This obviously requires the implementation of
the pEqualGreater, which is tested along with all other additions and 
removals between PT and Pascal in this directory. One
should be able to extrapolate this example to the rest of the pass
case tests. For failure case tests such as oldNotEqualFail.pt we simply
expect an illegal token or a different token. As an additional note the 
double ampersand and other logical operators unique to QUST are tested in 
this directory . To run all syntax output token related tests run the 
bash script testAllLocal.sh
